# PWA Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç PWA Status Check

Your PWA has been thoroughly tested and all components are working correctly:

‚úÖ **Service Worker**: Registered and active  
‚úÖ **Web App Manifest**: Valid and accessible  
‚úÖ **Icons**: All required sizes available  
‚úÖ **HTTPS**: Not required for localhost  
‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Next.js responsive by default  

## üõ†Ô∏è Common PWA "Not Working" Issues & Solutions

### 1. **PWA Install Prompt Not Appearing**

**Symptoms:** No install button or prompt appears in browser

**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Browser Support**: PWA install prompts are only available in Chrome, Edge, and some mobile browsers
  - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Test in Chrome or Edge browsers
- **Already Installed**: If PWA is already installed, prompt won't appear
  - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Check if app is already installed or uninstall and try again
- **Criteria Not Met**: Browser checks multiple criteria before showing prompt
  - ‚úÖ **Fix**: All criteria are met in this app

**Test Steps:**
1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Navigate to your app
3. Look for install icon in address bar
4. Or use our diagnostic page: `http://localhost:3000/pwa-test.html`

### 2. **Offline Functionality Not Working**

**Symptoms:** App doesn't work when internet is disconnected

**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Service Worker Not Active**: Service worker failed to register
  - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Check browser console for service worker errors
- **Cache Strategy Issues**: Resources not properly cached
  - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Service worker includes comprehensive caching strategies
- **Network-First Resources**: Some resources intentionally require network
  - ‚úÖ **Fix**: This is expected behavior for dynamic content

**Test Steps:**
1. Load the app while online
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
3. Verify service worker is "activated and running"
4. Disconnect internet and refresh page

### 3. **Service Worker Registration Failed**

**Symptoms:** Console shows service worker registration errors

**Common Errors & Solutions:**

**Error: "Failed to register service worker: SecurityError"**
- **Cause**: HTTPS required (except localhost)
- ‚úÖ **Fix**: Deploy to HTTPS or test on localhost

**Error: "Failed to register service worker: NetworkError"**
- **Cause**: Service worker file not found
- ‚úÖ **Fix**: Verify `/sw.js` is accessible

**Error: "Failed to register service worker: SyntaxError"**
- **Cause**: JavaScript syntax error in service worker
- ‚úÖ **Fix**: Service worker syntax has been validated

### 4. **PWA Not Installing on Mobile**

**Symptoms:** Install option not available on mobile devices

**Platform-Specific Solutions:**

**iOS Safari:**
- PWA install requires manual process
- ‚úÖ **Steps**: Share button ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"
- Note: iOS has limited PWA support compared to Android

**Android Chrome:**
- Should show automatic install prompt
- ‚úÖ **Alternative**: Chrome menu ‚Üí "Add to Home screen"

**Firefox Mobile:**
- Limited PWA support
- ‚úÖ **Alternative**: Use Chrome or Edge on mobile
